  <em>A typical example of drop generation. A liquid jet is ejected from a circular orifice when a 
piezoelectric diaphragm is flexed. As the diaphragm relaxes, the stream is retracted while capillary
forces pinch off a drop. The upward motion of the stream during pinch-off directs the drop 
upward, allowing oscillations of the dropâ€™s interface to decay before it descends. The video is 
played at 3/1600x real speed</em>
