## Overview

Particles floating at an oil–water interface can aggregate via lateral capillary interactions to form granular rafts
with unique mechanical properties. When destabilized—either spontaneously or through external forcing—
these rafts can encapsulate oil within armored drops. Here, we investigate the forced destabilization of such
rafts by indenting them with cylinders of varying size and at various speeds. We identify three distinct phases
of destabilization: stable deformation, particle ejection, and oil encapsulation. The onset of particle ejection is
explained by considering the cumulative weight of particles coating the indenter, with the particle ejection rate
increasing with indentation depth. The encapsulation process consists of a dripping regime, where individual
encapsulated oil drops grow and detach under gravity, and a jetting regime, where a continuous oil thread breaks
into drops via capillary instability. In the dripping regime, drop size increases with the indenter size, and drop
frequency increases with indentation depth. In contrast, the jetting regime produces smaller, more frequent
drops with higher size variability due to the dynamic nature of the instability. After destabilization, a residual
cap of particles remains adhered to the indenter whose size scales with an effective Bond number incorporating
the total particle weight.
